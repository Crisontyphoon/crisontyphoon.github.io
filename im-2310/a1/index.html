              <ol>
                     <li> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li>
                     The first thing i was paying attention to was the acknowledgement of country.
                     <li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</li>
                     <ul>
                            <li>Scrolled down to look at what art is presented</li>
                            <li>pressed on the "what's on tab</li>
                            <li>scrolled down and clicked on the "China- The Past is Present Tour"</li>
                     </ul>
                     <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li>
                     Reading the descriptions on certain events.
                     <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li>
                     looking for other headings that would interest me.
                     <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li>
                     I believe the primary goal was to create obvious headings of certain events that are occouring in the NGV
                     <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</li>
                     The way the use to achieve this is by habing a white background with contrasting black text, and enlarged/bolded the imortant headings or titles.
                     <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li>
                     Short but still somewhat infomative, where specific infomation should be shown.
                     <li>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</li>
                     uhh no clue
